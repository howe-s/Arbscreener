Challenges

Instead of using React for saved states, I faced the challenge of passing data the server, to the client, back to the server, and the subsequentlly back to the client.
This was done by making the initial request with python, detecting the div the user clicked on, extracted the relavent information from the div using Javascript, that data
was then passed to a python route for a second request for information on the address speciically, and then posted back to the client side for display.
