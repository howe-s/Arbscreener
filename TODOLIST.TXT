1. Caching (starting) ## DONE
2. Reduce API usage ## DONE
3. Make third contract find modular ## DONE
5. Identify the right third contract lol
4. Store known pairs into SQL to reduce run time?
5. Improve login security



Front end nonsense
1. landing page styled
2. landing page info and contact 
3. Search pair styled (this is going to suck lol)
4. user pair restyled

Maybe consider making this all one page if at all possible? 


Bonus: Stylized Charts for their searched assets? 



### BIGGGGG IDEAS

1. BUILD A LIGHT-WEIGHT, ADDRESS CHECKER USING THE CONTRACTS IN THE DB
2. START SCRAPING 
3. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HOST THIS 
4. Is there even a possibility we're adding SQL caching again to this? Or do we build this DB off user data
